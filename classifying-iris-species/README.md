# End to End with classfying iris species

In this notebook i'm going to build a machine learning program which classify iris spaces into three different classes.

## 1. Problem definition.
We're going to classify iris species using machine learning algorithms.

## 2. Data Definition.
Data come from SciKit-Learn standard datasets called `Iris dataset`.

This data sets consists of 3 different types of irisesâ€™ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray

The rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.
